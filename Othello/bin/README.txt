To run project, run class Main where the main method is located. The main 
method asks the user the basic questions related to the game preferences
and creates a new instance of the class Max, Min, and Game. Once playGame
is called it will run the game loop consistent with the user's preferences. 

All Minimax related functions are located in class Max.
